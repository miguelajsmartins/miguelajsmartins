- 👋 Hi, I’m @miguelajsmartins
- 👀 I’m interested in Astroparticle Physics, High Energy Hadronic Interactions and Cascade Physics
- 🌱 I’m currently doing my PhD in probing hadronic interactions in the early stages of Extensive Air Showers (EAS) triggered by the ultra-high energy cosmic rays. Also working on updating the reconstruction of inclined EAS at the Pierre Auger Observatory. Trying to include time information in the analysis of small-scale anisotropies in the arrival of UHECRs.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
